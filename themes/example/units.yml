### Unit list
# Contains definitions for all units in the game.
# Will be parsed in-game and used to create the different unit types at runtime.

# Some attributes explained:
# 
# unit_sprites
# This contains one or more sprites that are shown in game to represent the unit in each
# direction.
# It can consist of different data types, signifying different meanings:
# It can contain only a string, an image path to one sprite that will represent the unit
# in game. This is useful for static entities, buildings etc.
# It can contain an array with 6 image paths, for each direction starting with 'west' and
# then going clock-wise:
# [0] southwest, [1] northwest, [2] north, [3] northeast, [4] southeast, [5] south
# It can finally also contain multiple arrays, each with 1 or 6 image paths. In this case
# a random array is chosen and used. This way you can easily include variations of a units look
# and even mix one-directional and multi-directional unit graphics, if desired.
# --
# base_defense (int)
# This is factored into calculating the damage done by attacks.
# --
# armor (int)
# This is factored into calculating the damage done by various weapon types.
# armor_piercing weapons are more effective against this unit if the value is greater than zero.
# explosive weapons are more effective against this unit if the value is smaller or equal to zero.
# --
# movement_points (int)
# The number of tiles with movement_cost = 1 this unit can cross in one turn. If the terrain
# is rugged and has higher movement_cost, the number of tiles is reduced accordingly.
# --
# fuel (int)
# The amount of movement_points a unit has in general before it needs refueling.
# This value can be -1 if the unit consumes no fuel.
# --
# main_ammo (int)
# How many times can this unit attack until ammo runs out, not really how many shots it carries.
# --
# attack_bonus (int)
# This can be thought of as a "base_attack" value of the unit. It is simply added to the 
# main_weapon attack_strength value. It could be used to signify better training of this 
# unit or technical characteristics that would give it a significant attack boost compared 
# to another unit with the same main_weapon.
# This will be mostly used via modifiers.

# Note that the container id / top level ID given is the id of the unit.
# It is not explicitly named but used as "unit_id"
