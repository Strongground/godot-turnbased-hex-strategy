### This holds information about the attacks (or weapons) of
### units in the game (defined via units.yaml). Units reference
### the ID of a weapon from this file. Here, the characterictics
### of the weapons are put in detail. This is to avoid duplication
### since the assumption is, that there is always less variety
### in weapons than units - but this may depend on the specifity of
### the theme.
###
### The name of the container for each weapon in this file is never
### used, therefore doesn't matter.

### Some attributes explained:
### attack_strength
### Main attack value that is set against base_defense and other attribute
### bonuses and modifiers
### --
### armor_piercing
### If zero, weapon has reduced effect against armored targets
### If 1, @TODO What then?
### If greater than zero, @TODO What then?
### --
### area_of_effect
### how many tiles surrounding the impacting tile are hit?
### --
### aoe_falloff
### Values in percentage of fallof from center to outer tiles.
### Explanation:
### If area_of_effect is 3 and this is set to 0, all tiles that are hit share
### the same amount of damage dealt. This is useful for artillery where multiple
### warheads are hitting a broader area.
### If area_of_effect is 3 and this is set to a value greater than 0, the center
### tile will have 100% damage effect, the tiles immediatly surrounding it only 50% and
### the outer ring of tiles only 25% of the damage effect.
### --
### range
### how far away can the target be, so that attacking with this weapon is possible?
### 1 means units have to be adjacent.
### --
### effect
### references a spritesheet for an animation.
### --
### sound
### references a soundfile that is played, whenever this weapon fires. The sound should
### include the firing as well as the 'hit' sound (explosion, impact of bullets, impact
### of blade etc.)
### @TODO Maybe think about having hit sound and firing sound separated later. Hit sound
### could indicate wether target is armored or not and even if hit or miss.
