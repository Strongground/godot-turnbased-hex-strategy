### This holds information about the attacks (or weapons) of
### units in the game (defined via units.yaml). Units reference
### the ID of a weapon from this file. Here, the characterictics
### of the weapons are put in detail. This is to avoid duplication
### since the assumption is, that there is always less variety
### in weapons than units - but this may depend on the specifity of
### the theme.
###
### The name of the container for each weapon in this file is used
### to reference the weapon in a units definition.

### Some attributes explained:
### attack_strength (int)
### Main attack value that is set against base_defense and other attribute
### bonuses and modifiers
### --
### armor_piercing (int)
### If smaller or equal to zero, weapon has reduced effect on a target with armor 
### value greater or equal 1.
### If greater or equal to 1, this weapon is considered armor piercing and its
### effect on a target with armor value greater or equal 1 is multiplied by factor 0.5,
### then reduced by the factorized sum of armor value of the target unit.
### --
### explosive (int)
### If smaller or equal to zero, weapon has normal effect against soft targets 
### (targets where armor less or equal to zero)
### If greater or equal to 1, this weapon is considered explosive, and its effect
### on a soft target (armor value smaller or equal to zero) is multiplied by factor 2
### then reduced by the factorized sum of base_defense value of the target unit.
### --
### area_of_effect (int)
### how many tiles surrounding the impacting tile are hit?
### --
### aoe_falloff (int)
### Values in percentage of fallof from center to outer tiles.
### Explanation:
### If area_of_effect is 3 and this is set to 0, all tiles that are hit share
### the same amount of damage dealt. This is useful for artillery or units with bows,
### were spread is a major factor, intentional or not.
### If area_of_effect is 3 and this is set to a value greater than 0, the center
### tile will have 100% damage effect, the tiles immediatly surrounding it only 66% and
### the outer ring of tiles only 33% of the damage effect (linear falloff)
### --
### attacks_units (array|string)
### An array containing strings or single string describing, what units can be hit by this
### weapon effectively. While almost all weapons can be fired at all targets, most have a 
### clearly defined target definition. It is next to impossible to hit a passing fighter jet 
### or a battleship in coastal firing position, with an assault rifle. A battleships main 
### cannon, in turn, cannot hope to hit a fighter jet.
### This is in part assumption, but should always be self-explanatory and/or common knowledge.
### Scenarios like attacking an armored tank with a sword is not covered by this, as this is
### handled implicitely by the battle/damage system and weapon definitions.
### --
### range
### how far away can the target be, so that attacking with this weapon is possible?
### 1 means units have to be on adjacent tiles.
### --
### effect
### references a external spritesheet file from the theme for an animation or the name 
### of an existing standard animation from the core game.
### --
### sound
### references a soundfile that is played, whenever this weapon fires. The sound should
### include the firing as well as the 'hit' sound (explosion, impact of bullets, impact
### of blade etc.)
### @TODO Maybe think about having hit sound and firing sound separated later. Hit sound
### could be played conditionally based on target, thus indicating wether target is armored
### or not (effect on target) and even if the attack was a hit or miss.
