# This contains all modifiers for this theme. A modifier is a combination of a
# stat modifier for a unit (for example '+1 movement_points', '-2 base_defense')
# as well as description, icon and name for showing ingame.
# It can have a duration as well.
# One modifier can only be active once per unit but unlimited modifiers can be applied
# per unit.

# As in all theme data files, the container ID of a modifier is not used in game,
# only the 'mod_id' inside the container, so name the containers like you want.

# duration: Number of turns until the modifier will be removed.
# It can be applied again immedietly. If the duration is set to -1, the modifier
# will never be removed, except explicitly.

# modifiers: Contains the name of an attribute of units. But not all of them can
# be modified by a modifier. Just for reference, the attributes available to modifiers
# are:
# base_defense
# attack_bonus
# armored
# movement_points
#
# The modifier itself is just an int that can be either negative or positive. It is added to the
# units attribute when the modifier is active for a given unit.
# Please note:
# All attributes will be capped to zero. Negative values for ammo, movement_points etc. don't make
# sense. So to set an attribute to 0, without knowing the value before, use arbitrary large modifiers
# like -999.
# If an attribute that can be either "bool" or "int" is changed by a modifier and the result
# is <= 0, it will result in the attribute being "false" while any other result will change
# the attribute type to "int" if it was "bool".
# If a attribute is modified twice in the same modifier, and it is applied, the last occurance
# will win.
